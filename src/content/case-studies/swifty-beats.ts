    "Swifty Beats is a music and entertainment brand built around live events, studio sessions and a fast-growing online audience, a name that trades on energy, momentum and a distinct sound.",
  theChallenge:
    "The music spoke for itself, but the brand around it did not yet match its ambition. Swifty Beats needed a bold, unmistakable identity and a social presence with the same rhythm as the sets, one that carries across stages, screens and streaming platforms.",
  delivered: {
    "Design & Branding":
      "A high-energy identity built for motion: a flexible logo, a charged colour palette and a typographic system designed to hold its own against neon, stage light and a small phone screen alike.",
    "Social Media":
      "A content system with a consistent visual beat, turning clips, releases and live moments into a recognisable feed that keeps the audience warm between events.",
